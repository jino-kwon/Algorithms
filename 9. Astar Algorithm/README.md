# 9. A* Algorithm (8-Puzzle Problem)

**Program Specs:**

Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A* search. 
The three A* functions to be used in this program are:

1. g(n) = # of moves from initial state to node/state n
2. h*(n) = the total distance for all tiles to move from node/state n to the goal state.
3. f*(n) = g(n) + h*(n)
