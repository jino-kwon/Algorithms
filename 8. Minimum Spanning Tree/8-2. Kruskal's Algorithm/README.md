# 8-2. Kruskal's Algorithm

**Program Specs:**

The algorithm in general is quite similar to Prim's Algorithm.
However, unlike Prime's algorithm which uses 2 sets to construct MST, Kruskal's algorithm starts with a singleton set to construct MST.
It merges two sets in each iteration --- until all nodes belong to the same set.
