# 8-1. Prim's Algorithm

**Program Specs:**

Given a connected, undirected graph, G, use the Primâ€™s Algorithm to make a Minimum Spanning Tree of G.
Prim's algorithm uses two sets (set A and set B) to construct a MST of G.

Initially, setA contains only one node (which can be any node in G) and setB contains the rest of nodes. Run the program four times, using 1, 4, 8, 12, on each run as the initial node in setA.
