# 8-1. Prim's Algorithm

**Program Specs:**

Given a connected, undirected graph, G, use the Primâ€™s Algorithm to make a Minimum Spanning Tree of G.
Prim's algorithm uses two sets, setA and setB to construct a MST of G.
Initially, setA contains only one node (can be any node in G) and setB contains the rest of nodes.
run your program four (4) times, using 1, 4, 8, 12 on each run as the initial node in setA.
