# Implementation of Stacks, Queues, Ordered List

**Program Specs**:

The operations include insertion, deletion, and print.
The input file contains a list of pair {<op, data>} where op is either + or -, where + means insert, - means remove, and data is a positive integer.
For example, + 10, means insert 10, -20 means remove 20.

The program will construct a stack, a queue, and then, an ordered list (sorted in ascending order), all in linked list implementations.
The program will perform a set of operations, given by the input pairs, on the Stack/Queue/Ordered List.
