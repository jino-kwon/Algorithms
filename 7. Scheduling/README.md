# 7. Scheduling

**Program Specs:**

The main task is to implement a dependency graph for scheduling.
The input consists of two files: (1) the first file contains a graph, and (2) the second file contains processing time for each node.
The number of processors that can be used for scheduling will also be provided in runtime.

There can be four cases for scheduling:

1. using limited processors where each job takes 1 unit of processing time
2. using limited processors where jobs take variable unit of processing time
3. using unlimited processors where each job takes 1 unit of processing time
4. using unlimited processors where jobs take variable unit of processing time
