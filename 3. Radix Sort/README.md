# Radix Sort

**Program Specs**:

A version of radix sort is implemented. The program sorts either (1) a file containing all positive integers or (2) a file containing a mix of positive and negative integers. 
The program will calculate an offset number to be added to all the numbers in the file before doing the radix sort.
- In the first case where all input numbers are positive, the offset would be just zero ('0').
- Meanwhile, for the second case where there are a mix of negative/positive numbers, the largest negative integer will be chosen as an offset number. In this way, all the numbers plugged into the radix sort algorithm will be all positive numbers.
