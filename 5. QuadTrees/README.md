# 5. Quad Trees

**Program Specs:**
The task is to implement a quad tree. The input file is an image coded in binary. Construct a quad tree, print out the tree, and traverse it using preorder/inorder/postorder traverse.

The first line of the input file is the header information: number of rows, the number of columns, the mininum value, and the maximum value. The following line will be rows and columns of pixels (in binary).
- Here's an example:

  4 5 0 1

  0 0 0 1 0

  0 1 1 0 1

  0 0 1 0 1

  1 0 1 1 1
